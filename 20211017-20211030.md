- ##### 2nd 3DReps workshop @ ICCV_2021

We are organizing the Second #3DReps workshop at @ICCV_2021 to bring together researchers working on learned 3D representations. We have an amazing lineup of invited speakers and posters. Please join us tomorrow (Oct 17)! Full schedule here: https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/3DReps/

Invited speakers include Katerina Fragkiadaki, Noah Goodman, @lipmanya, Jitendra Malik, Dmitriy Smirnov, @SongShuran, and Andrea Vedaldi @Oxford_VGG.

We are also organizing breakout sessions for poster presenters on three topics: Humans and Robots, Surfaces and Points, and Generation and Recognition. Join us on http://Gather.town for this interactive breakout.

Made possible thanks to my wonderful co-organizers @FidlerSanja, Leo Guibas, @orlitany, @tanner_schmidt_, @vincesitzmann, @shubhtuls, and @GordonWetzstein.

- ##### MuJoCo physics simulator

  [DeepMind](https://twitter.com/DeepMind)
  
  We’ve acquired the MuJoCo physics simulator (http://mujoco.org) and are making it free for all, to support research everywhere. MuJoCo is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use, and soon to be open-source simulation tool, designed for robotics research: http://dpmd.ai/mujoco-blog

  - **Sam Aardvark:** Wow. Fantastic. One question: why would you do this? Do you make money if it’s open source? If so, how? If not, you obviously want a return on your investment, how are you getting it?
    - **Josh Marlow:** DeepMind also benefits from the research produced by other labs. Making research infrastructure more accessible -> more research -> more papers -> more work they can potentially incorporate into their own. Also, if they use this internally, they benefit from oss contributions.
  
  - **Yuke Zhu:** Kudos to @DeepMind, MuJoCo (physics engine behind robosuite) is now free and soon open-source to all. We hope that it will expedite reproducible and open robotics research further. Check out the list of great work from the Robot Learning community using robosuite here: http://robosuite.ai/docs/references.html
