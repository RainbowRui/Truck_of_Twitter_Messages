This course covers the advances in neural rendering over the last year. We will first cover the fundamentals of machine learning and computer graphics relevant for neural rendering. Next, we will present state of the art techniques for the many important neural rendering methods for applications such as novel view synthesis, semantic photo manipulation, facial and body reenactment, relighting, free-viewpoint video, and the creation of photo-realistic avatars for virtual and augmented reality telepresence. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion on the ethical implications of this technology and open research problems.

As part of the African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI 2021), we have delivered a course on Geometric Deep Learing (GDL100), which closely follows the contents of our GDL proto-book. We make all materials and artefacts from this course publicly available, as companion material for our proto-book, as well as a way to dive deeper into some of the contents for future iterations of the book.

#### SIGGRAPH Q&A session：

#### content:
Emerging research in computer graphics, inverse problems, and machine learning requires us to differentiate and optimize parametric discontinuities. These discontinuities appear in object boundaries, occlusion, contact, and sudden change over time. In many domains, such as rendering and physics simulation, we differentiate the parameters of models that are expressed as integrals over discontinuous functions. Ignoring the discontinuities during differentiation often has a significant impact on the optimization process. Previous approaches either apply specialized hand-derived solutions, smooth out the discontinuities, or rely on incorrect automatic differentiation.  

We propose a systematic approach to differentiating integrals with discontinuous integrands, by developing a new differentiable programming language. We introduce integration as a language primitive and account for the Dirac delta contribution from differentiating parametric discontinuities in the integrand. We formally define the language semantics and prove the correctness and closure under the differentiation, allowing the generation of gradients and higher-order derivatives. We also build a system, Teg, implementing these semantics. Our approach is widely applicable to a variety of tasks, including image stylization, fitting shader parameters, trajectory optimization, and optimizing physical designs.

Computer Vision is broadly defined as the study of recovering useful properties of the world from one or more images.  In recent years, Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing computer vision tasks.  This course will cover a range of foundational topics at the intersection of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

#### content:
Deep learning methods have been a tremendously effective approach to problems in computer vision and natural language processing. However, these black-box models can be difficult to deploy in practice as they are known to make unpredictable mistakes that can be hard to analyze and correct. In this talk, I will present collaborative research to develop visually interactive interfaces for probabilistic deep learning models, with the goal of allowing users to examine and correct black-box models through visualizations and interactive inputs. Through co-design of models and visual interfaces, we will take the necessary next steps for model interpretability. Achieving this aim requires active investigation into developing new deep learning models and analysis techniques, and integrating them within interactive visualization frameworks.

### ICCV 2021 workshop "Learning 3D Representations for Shape and Appearance"

#### content:
There is increasing interest in developing representations for problems such as 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis, texture synthesis, and shape generation. The leading approaches for these problems can roughly be split into explicit, learned implicit, and semi-implicit representations of humans, objects, and scenes. While being closely related, research in these topics has been mostly distinct. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers in the field to discuss in depth each of these approaches, how they differ from each other and in what ways they could potentially be merged, combining the best features of each. The workshop will have invited talks and posters from leading experts in these topics, and a panel discussion to discuss future directions.

### The 2021 Innovations Dialogue: Deepfakes, Trust And International Security

#### content:
The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) welcomes you to the 2021 Innovations Dialogue: Deepfakes, Trust and International Security. This one-day convening will explore the importance of trust for international security and stability and shed light on how the growing deepfake phenomenon could undermine this trust. 

The world today is suffering from a “trust deficit disorder,” as noted by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, wherein trust among states and in multilateral processes has weakened. Trust is a central pillar of international security and stability. It sets the foundation for cooperation, institution-building and multilateralism, and rests on the ability of actors to learn, perceive, and believe others’ interests, positions and actions through means of communication. In a world where digital forms of communication are ubiquitous, the emergence of AI-enabled digital visual and textual media fabrication and manipulation technology known as deepfakes could further subvert trust and challenge its preconditions at an individual, systemic and societal level, thereby endangering international security and stability. 

With the participation of stakeholders from government, academia, and industry, the Dialogue will illuminate how algorithmically generated synthetic visual and textual media is created and disseminated, and examine how it could erode trust and present novel risks for international security and stability. The discussions will also explore the key governance issues concerning deepfakes and their attendant technological countermeasures, and consider whether new multilateral and multi-stakeholder tools are needed to fill the governance gaps that deepfakes have engendered.
