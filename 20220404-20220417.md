  - Please be mindful of your colour choices in plots for those that cannot differentiate them.  At the very least, use different symbols.

    - What happens when a top representation theorist (Geordie Williamson) covers geometric deep learning? IMHO, one of the most beautiful talks on the topic.

  - Lecture 2 is out!🤓Steerable G-CNNs. I did my best to keep it as intuitive as possibl; went all out on colorful figs/gifs/eqs, even went through the hassle of rewriting harmonic nets @danielewworrall as regular G-CNNs to make a case!😅Hope y'all like it!

    - iSDF uses the main incremental neural field training methods of iMAP, but interprets the MLP output as a signed distance field rather than occupancy. Similar reconstruction quality, with auto hole-filling. Directly building an SDF could be useful for some robot planning cases.

  - IMavatar (#CVPR2022) learns implicit head avatars from monocular videos. It represents the expression and pose deformations via learned blendshapes and skinning fields. These are used to morph the canonical geometry and texture fields given novel expression and pose parameters.
  - IMavatars are learned end-to-end from video and provide fine-grain animation control using FLAME parameters. This produces implicit head avatars with more realistic shape (see the detailed normal maps) and appearance than the recent SOTA.

  - Check out AutoRF: Learning 3D Object Radiance Fields from Single View Observations #CVPR2022 by @Normanisation. 
  - Key idea: we learn shape & appearance priors from single-view training samples by exploiting machine-annotated labels!

  - comments:
    - question1: How does it figure out the homography, angle and probably rotation of the camera? What about places where the floor is on different heights through the scene?
    - reply1: We leverage off-the-shelf monocular 3D detections to calculate the relative pose of the camera. This way we can also support different floor levels
