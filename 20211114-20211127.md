- **Tamara Munzner:** The crusade where I’m so often shouting into the wind is my hatred of the solo / non-referential “This”: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/writing.html#this

#CVPR2022 tip: Make sure you periodically download a local copy of your LaTeX files.  In the past, online services have struggled to stay up near the submission deadline.

- **Michael Black:** Better yet, pay for the upgraded version of Overleaf and you can automatically sync it with your Dropbox. Then if Overleaf goes down, you have a version on your disk. Magic. At least one person on every team should do this. Tip: if someone just shares the link with you, it doesn't sync with Dropbox.  You need to "join" the project.

- ##### ML with differential geometry/algebraic topology

  [Michael Bronstein](https://twitter.com/mmbronstein)
  
  After a hiatus, a new series of blogs posts. Do differential geometry and algebraic topology sound too exotic for ML? In recent works, we show that tools from these fields bring a new perspective on graph neural networks.
  
  First post in the series: https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-neural-networks-through-the-lens-of-differential-geometry-and-algebraic-topology-3a7c3c22d5f
  
  Part II will discuss topological message passing. Part III will deal with geometric flows and non-euclidean diffusion PDEs on graphs. Part IV will show how the over-squashing phenomena relate to graph curvature, and offer a graph rewiring approach inspired by the Ricci flow.

- ##### self-supervised multilingual model

  [Meta AI](https://twitter.com/MetaAI)
  
  We're releasing XLS-R, a self-supervised multilingual model trained on 128 languages for a variety of speech tasks. XLS-R sets a new state of the art on several speech recognition benchmarks, foreign-to-English speech translation & language identification. https://ai.facebook.com/blog/xls-r-self-supervised-speech-processing-for-128-languages
