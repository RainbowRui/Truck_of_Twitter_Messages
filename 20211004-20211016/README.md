- ##### Neural implicit humans

  [Michael Black](https://twitter.com/Michael_J_Black)
  
  Neural implicit humans are coming. The key: define a forward skinning deformation field in a pose-independent space. SNARF learns this without direct supervision. At #ICCV2021. Code online.

  - **Gerard Pons-Moll:** Congrats! nice generalization! We also have a neural implicit human paper at ICCV (Neural-GIF).

- ##### Indoor Inverse Rendering

  [Zian Wang](https://twitter.com/zianwang97)
  
  Excited to share our #ICCV2021 paper “Learning Indoor Inverse Rendering with 3D Spatially-Varying Lighting”! It handles 3D lighting, disentangles spatially-varying effects, and benefits AR applications.
