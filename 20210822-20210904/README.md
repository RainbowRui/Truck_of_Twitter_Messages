  **Gedjglah**: Maybe as humans, we dramatically discount all other features(including peripheral facial features like moustache, scars) compared to the core-facial features.

  **Research can be quite brutal when a paper gets rejected.**
  
  Successful groups have the problem with many rejected submissions; but they don't give up, take reviewer feedback, and keep improving their work until it's ready for publication. Key is to recognize what was missing.
  
  **Abdullah Hamdi:** How to deal with deteriorating motivation to work on rejected papers and to ignore the exciting new topics that are emerging all the time?
  
  **Alessandro Saccon:** Even unsuccessful groups face the same issue. Just the key idea is neither good nor new enough, and their paper will never get accepted or less cited. So the real question for me is: how do you get a great idea?

  **3D Reconstruction from public webcams**
  
  Hey @AmirRubin, check out this 3D #computervision project which uses SuperGlue, a deep feature-based matcher—extremely useful for creating a robust #digitaltwin of outdoor spaces. Thanks @ducha_aiki for sharing!

  - **Amir Rubin:** I love this! SuperGlue and deep front ends are game changers for 3D reconstruction. The robustness of learned features+homography is bringing digital twin creation into the hands of non-expert users. I mean, I’m not talking metaverse scale just yet but who knows?

  - **Noé:** Wow indeed, this is wild. It's the difference between an idea not working at all, and working quite well. There have to be ideas from the past which did not pan out that have to be re-investigated! Do you have insights on use-cases where it made a large difference?
