#### How to store 3D scenes/grids efficiently? 

[Matthias Niessner](https://twitter.com/MattNiessner)

Just hash occupied voxels, 𝐻(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)=(𝑥⋅𝑝_1⨁ 𝑦⋅𝑝_2⨁ 𝑧⋅𝑝_3) mod 𝑛, and store them in a linear array!

The voxel hashing method proposed this for 3D recon in 2013, but it's used in many apps such as sparse conv nets!

To access the value of a voxel, simply evaluate the hash, e.g., for a filter kernel or to update a TSDF value.

Why are hashes so powerful? 

Data access *and* insertion is O(1) - ignoring collisions. In comparison, for tree structures, such as octrees, that's O(log(n)).

Wasn't that a paper by @sylefeb, too?https://t.co/SUwJlGNxcY

Thanks for the mention! We have some other works on the topic too (e.g. showing that coalesced accesses are possible through a hash on the GPU: https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00624777/document  )

What do you with dynamic objects moving through the grids? Do you need to remove them from the voxel they were in and then add them to the voxel they move into? Seems like removal of an object from one voxel takes o(n).

[Morten Vassvik]
I can't find a list of the bounding box spans of all the test cases in the paper. In most cases at least one dimension is missing, e.g. Figure 1 doesn't mention the depth, so I'm not able to compute the efficient sparsity and span of each case. Are these available somewhere? :)

  almost think the non compatible combinations are more promising for art

  They propose the interesting idea to leverage that we can get more expressive GNNs if we consider perturbations of the original graph in addition to the original graph.
