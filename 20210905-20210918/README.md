- **关于AI技术的思考**

  [Matthias Niessner](https://twitter.com/MattNiessner)
  
  There's still this illusion that "AI" is somewhat intelligent: these are models fitted to large datasets using non-linear optimizations, hoping to replicate their distributions. While these are incredibly useful tools, there is nothing we would consider human-like intelligence.
  
  - **Theodore Galanos:** GPT3 has definitely shown instances of human-like intelligence, although I doubt that qualification is all important for AGI. I agree it's not specifically the model or the architecture but I do entirely believe it is the 'large datasets',  specifically the language ones.
    - **John Manoochehri:** inb4 it's like something computational which we have detected in human intelligence.
    - **Theodore Galanos:** Very far from an expert, my view is generalization to, if not arbitrary, rather novel downstream tasks with very little experience (and I believe generalization is a standard aspect of human intelligence?). Few-shot, zero-shot, prompt engineering, have shown glimpses of that.
    - **John Manoochehri:** Except it's the opposite: all the ML training req'd is exactly what we have to assume humans don't have, at least in the very prominent case of language acquisition.
  
  - **Zayd:** True intelligence is the unsupervised learning. GPT-3 is good at data (and combinations of) it has seen. It can't go beyond that.

  So my question is, is @openreviewnet going so survey reviewers/authors to try to improve their system? And what's the improvements that are being currently being engineered? I'd gladly contribute $$ to see it improve in time.

- ##### 3D Human texture estimation

  [Chen Change Loy](https://twitter.com/ccloy)

  **New iccv2021 oral paper with [JohnXu_2015](https://twitter.com/JohnXu_2015)!  Texformer estimates high-quality 3D human texture from a single image. The    Transformer-based method allows efficient information interchange between the image space and UV texture space.**
