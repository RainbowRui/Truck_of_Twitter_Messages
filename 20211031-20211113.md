- ##### DIGIT

  [Meta AI](https://twitter.com/facebookai)
  
  Today, as part of a larger tactile-sensing ecosystem, we’re announcing two major advances: DIGIT, a commercially available touch-sensing hardware produced in partnership with GelSight, and ReSkin, a replaceable, low-cost tactile skin.
  
  In addition to hardware such as DIGIT, developing touch sensing as a modality requires an ecosystem of touch processors, simulators, benchmarks & data sets. Read more about our ongoing work in developing & open-sourcing this ecosystem: https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-robots-to-perceive-understand-and-interact-through-touch

  We’re also open-sourcing ReSkin, an affordable tactile sensor that autocalibrates through self-supervision. ReSkin will help to advance AI’s ability to obtain & use tactile data, getting us closer to deploying reliable touch sensing in research.

  These innovations will advance AI and help us make progress toward developing gentler, safer robots capable of understanding the world through touch. Accessible touch-sensing hardware could also open up the field of tactile sensing to more researchers.
