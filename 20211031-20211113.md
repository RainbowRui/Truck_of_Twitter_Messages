- ##### DIGIT

  [Meta AI](https://twitter.com/facebookai)
  
  Today, as part of a larger tactile-sensing ecosystem, we’re announcing two major advances: DIGIT, a commercially available touch-sensing hardware produced in partnership with GelSight, and ReSkin, a replaceable, low-cost tactile skin.
  
  In addition to hardware such as DIGIT, developing touch sensing as a modality requires an ecosystem of touch processors, simulators, benchmarks & data sets. Read more about our ongoing work in developing & open-sourcing this ecosystem: https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-robots-to-perceive-understand-and-interact-through-touch

  We’re also open-sourcing ReSkin, an affordable tactile sensor that autocalibrates through self-supervision. ReSkin will help to advance AI’s ability to obtain & use tactile data, getting us closer to deploying reliable touch sensing in research.

  These innovations will advance AI and help us make progress toward developing gentler, safer robots capable of understanding the world through touch. Accessible touch-sensing hardware could also open up the field of tactile sensing to more researchers.

- ##### Polyscope

  [Nick Sharp](https://twitter.com/nmwsharp)
  
  Giant new v1.2 release of Polyscope! Adds support for tet & hex meshes, transparency, ground shadows, slice planes, variable-size points, setting camera views, and more. Try Polyscope for easy 3D visualization in C++ & Python: https://polyscope.run/
  
  Volume meshes have been added as a new structure, supporting tetrahedral and hexahedral elements, including mixed meshes with both tets and hexes. As always, you can also add scalar/color/vector data associated with the vertices or cells. http://polyscope.run/structures/volume_mesh/basics/
  
  Slices planes let you see inside your volume meshes, and any other surfaces/point clouds/etc in Polyscope too! Add slice planes to the scene, and position them manually or with a few lines of code. You can also apply them selectively to only some data. http://polyscope.run/features/slice_planes/
  
  Transparency is great for visualizations and figures where hidden content needs to be seen. Set an alpha value per-structure and you're good to go! Polyscope renders transparency with either weighted averaging (fast) or depth peeling (pretty). http://polyscope.run/features/transparency/
  
  The ground plane now supports soft transparent shadows, for those figure-ready renderings Smiling face with sunglasses Also, enable built-in antialiasing (SSAA) to bump up the visual quality. http://polyscope.run/features/ground_and_shadows/, http://polyscope.run/basics/program_options/#ssaa-anti-aliasing-factor
  
  Point clouds can now use a scalar quantity to set a radius per-point, and this works in conjunction with all the other features point clouds support! https://polyscope.run/structures/point_cloud/variable_radius/
  
  Surface meshes expose a back face policy, so reversed faces can be styled according to your application. As always, you can set this policy ahead of time in code, or change it at runtime in the GUI.
  
  Sometimes it's the little things: Polyscope now has a lookAt() function to easily position the camera. Great for creating your own renderings in automated scripts! Also, you can always copy & restore camera poses from the GUI with ctrl-C/ctrl-V. http://polyscope.run/basics/camera_controls/
  
  And more! New font, scalar isolines, a more flexible shader builder backend, new apple silicon python builds, and many bugfixes. Thanks to others who tested and contributed!
